# React Learning Journey - 2026

## Goal
Build React skills over 12 weeks to land a frontend developer role in Pennsylvania.

## Week 1: React Fundamentals (Feb 9-15, 2026)

### Day 1 - Monday, Feb 9 ✅
**What I Built:**
- Created first Vite + React project
- Built `Greeting` component that accepts `name` prop
- Learned how to reuse components with different data

**What I Learned:**
- How to create a React functional component
- How props pass data to components
- How JSX lets you write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- How Vite provides instant hot-reload during development

**Challenges:**
- Finding source files in VS Code (figured it out!)
- Understanding what Vite does (it's the dev server!)
- Git warnings about line endings (learned they're harmless!)

**Next:** Build Button, Card, and UserProfile components on Thursday
